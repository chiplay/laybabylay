Backbone dualStorage Adapter v1.1.0
===================================

A dualStorage adapter for Backbone. It's a drop-in replacement for Backbone.Sync() to handle saving to a localStorage database as a cache for the remote models.

Usage
-----

Include Backbone.dualStorage after having included Backbone.js:

    <script type="text/javascript" src="backbone.js"></script>
    <script type="text/javascript" src="backbone.dualstorage.js"></script>

Create your models and collections in the usual way.
Feel free to use Backbone as you usually would; this is a drop-in replacement.

Keep in mind that Backbone.dualStorage really loves your models. By default it will cache everything that passes through Backbone.sync. You can override this behaviour with the booleans ```remote``` or ```local``` on models and collections:

    SomeCollection = Backbone.Collection.extend({
        local: true  // always fetched and saved only locally, never saves on remote
        remote: true // never cached, dualStorage is bypassed entirely
    });

You can also deactivate dualsync to some requests, when you want to sync with the server only later.

    SomeCollection.create({name: "someone"}, {remote: false});

Data synchronization
--------------------

When the client goes offline, dualStorage allows you to keep changing and destroying records. All changes will be sent when the client goes online again.

    // server online. Go!
    People.fetch();       // load cars models and save them into localstorage

    // server offline!
    People.create({name: "Turing"});   // you still can create new cars...
    People.models[0].save({age: 41});  // update existing ones...
    People.models[1].destroy();        // and destroy as well

    // server online again!
    People.syncDirtyAndDestroyed();    // all changes are sent to the server and localStorage is updated

Keep in mind that if you try to fetch() a collection that has dirty data, only data currently in the localStorage will be loaded. collection.syncDirtyAndDestroyed() needs to be executed before trying to download new data from the server.

Data parsing
------------

Sometimes you may want to customize how data from the remote server is parsed before it's saved to localStorage.
Typically your model's `parse` method takes care of this.
Since dualStorage provides two layers of backend, we need a second parse method.
For example, if your remote API returns data in a way that the default `parse` method interprets the result as a single record,
use `parseBeforeLocalSave` to break up the data into an array of records like you would with [parse](http://backbonejs.org/#Model-parse).

* The model's `parse` method still parses data read from localStorage.
* The model's `parseBeforeLocalSave` method parses data read from the remote _before_ it is saved to localStorage on read.

Compiling
---------

Compile the coffeescript into javascript with `make`. This requires that node.js and coffee-script are installed.

    npm install -g coffee-script

    make

Testing
-------

To run the test suite, clone the project and open **SpecRunner.html** in a browser.

Note that the tests run against **spec/backbone.dualstorage.js**, not the copy in the project root.
The spec version needs to be unwrapped to allow mocking components for testing.
This version is compiled automatically when running `make`.

dualStorage has been tested against Backbone versions 0.9.2 - 1.0.0.
Test with other versions by altering the version included in `SpecRunner.html`.
